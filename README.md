### [Detect crown-of-thorns starfish in underwater image data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef)
Australia's stunningly beautiful Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest coral reef and home to 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of corals, 130 species of sharks, rays, and a massive variety of other sea life.

Unfortunately, the reef is under threat, in part because of the overpopulation of one particular starfish – the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (or COTS for short). Scientists, tourism operators and reef managers established a large-scale intervention program to control COTS outbreaks to ecologically sustainable levels
